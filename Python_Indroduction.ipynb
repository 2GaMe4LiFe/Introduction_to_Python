    "\n",
    "In Python, variables have a specified datatype. This datatype defines the operations that can be done with the variable. We have to tell the computer what kind of variable we are talking about, otherwise we would get unexpected results because we tried to compare a number with a word (or something like that). These are some (not all) datatypes:\n",

    "- Numbers\n",
    "    - boolean `bool`\n",
    "    - integer `int`\n",
    "    - real `float`\n",
    "- Sequences\n",
    "    - Immutable\n",
    "        - string `str`\n",
    "        - tuples `tuple`\n",

These values can be used in `if`-statements and are the result of comparison operators. Python actually saves these values as the numbers 1 and 0. Thats why `print(True + True)` results in `2`.\n",

If you want to know why, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23cKyM-iFqk). Of course, we do not need to memorise this number, but knowing that the max value of an integer is around 2,140,000,000 can be pretty helpful. As [recent events](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863950) have shown, it can break your program, if you excede this number.\n",

This way, the actual number is only an approximation, but still is this a good way to represent numbers with many decimal places. Try adding `0.1 + 0.2` and take a look at the output.
